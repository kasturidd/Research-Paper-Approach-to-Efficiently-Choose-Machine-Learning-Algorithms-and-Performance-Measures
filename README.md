# Approach-to-Efficiently-Choose-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-and-Performance-Measures | Research Paper
This research introduces a time-saving approach to selecting machine learning algorithms and performance measures tailored to specific business requirements, hardware constraints, and desired outcomes. Instead of testing multiple algorithms blindly, the method emphasizes understanding the problem, data, and constraints to identify the optimal algorithm and performance metrics. This approach streamlines the model development process, reduces redundant effort, and ensures that evaluation focuses on metrics most relevant to the use case.

Key topics: Algorithm selection, performance optimization, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
